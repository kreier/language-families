# Language families and the connection to Noah's family

Connect language families with the spread of Noah's family after the flood.

The Wikipedia articles about language families in [German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprachfamilie) and [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_family) contain some nice world maps already.

## Procedural generation

It might be possible to create a SVG or PDF with python and the [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) package (on [Github](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas)). Relevant maps in the SGX format might be available at Kaggle.

## History

This idea started on 2025/08/27 during a conversation with Brandon from Spokane. He created a map in 2005 with Photoshop, and the idea of an updated vector edition was born.
